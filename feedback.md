## Practical 3

- **Feedback**: Reflection.txt was not located in the Practical 3 folder.  
  **Action**: I moved the file into the correct directory (`Practical3/Reflection.txt`).

- **Feedback**: Commit messages were too generic and repetitive.  
  **Action**: I now use descriptive commit messages (e.g., "add Reflection to Practical3") to clearly state each change.

## Practical 4

- **Feedback**: No truth table comment in `variables.py`.  
  **Action**: I added a commented truth table showing all combinations of X and Y with corresponding W values.

- **Feedback**: Triangular number code lacked explanation.  
  **Action**: I added a brief comment explaining the triangular number formula and its logic.

- **Feedback**: Comment in `mystery_code.py` was ambiguous.  
  **Action**: I rephrased the comment to clearly state that the code generates pairs of random numbers and stops once a match occurs, reporting the number of iterations.

- **Feedback**: In `bmi_calculator.py`, pseudocode was brief and the formula was incorrect.  
  **Action**: I corrected the formula to `BMI = weight / (height ** 2)` and added a clearer pseudocode comment explaining the structure.

## Practical 5

- **Feedback**: Axis labels in bar chart were swapped; variable query unclear.  
  **Action**: I fixed the axis labels on the bar chart and rewrote the query so the language can be specified via a variable.
