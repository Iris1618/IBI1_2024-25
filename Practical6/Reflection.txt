Practical6 Reflection:
It is not easy as a 2 hours work.
But i enjoyed using code to get what i want and change the chart parameters to make it more delicate.
And i learned some new functions like zip() and the random.choice of numpy which is very useful.
And i found when i want to learn to use a new function, AI can be quite useful to intoduce its usage to me.
